The library includes essential image processing operations.

Features:
1. Error Diffusion with varying levels
2. 3 image sharpening techniques using the Laplacian filter.


# General
* The Fourier Transform is calculated in the spatial domain. The spatial domain refers to the domain of the original image, where the image is represented as a matrix of pixel values. When we apply the Fourier Transform to an image in the spatial domain, we are transforming it from the pixel representation to a representation in the frequency domain.
